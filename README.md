# `cqlsh`

`cqlsh` is a Python-based command-line client for running `CQL` commands on a `cassandra` cluster.

Normally it's packaged as part of the full Apache Cassandra™ installation. This repo repackages it into a standalone Python package for lighter-weight installs.

### Installing:

Install and update using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):
```
$ pip install -U cqlsh
```

### Running:

```
$ cqlsh --help
```

### Documentation:

Documentation is available as part of the official [Apache Cassandra™ documentation](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/tools/cqlsh.html).

### Contributing:

Because this is a repackaging of `cqlsh` from the official [Cassandra repo](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/cassandra.git), **only issues / PRs related to PyPI packaging should be opened against this repo**. If you would like to contribute to `cqlsh` itself, [find out more information here](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Steps to sanity check that the packaging works as expected:

1. Install `cqlsh` locally (probably in a `virtualenv`):
```
$ pip install . -e  # run from within the cqlsh directory
```
2. Start a local copy of Cassandra:
```
$ docker pull cassandra
$ docker run -it --rm -p 9042:9042 cassandra
```
3. Verify `cqlsh` successfully connects to the server:
```
$ cqlsh

Connected to Test Cluster at 127.0.0.1:9042

### Changelog:

Unfortunately the Cassandra project does not always increment the `cqlsh` version number, so for every
release we need to document not only the `cqlsh` version but also the `cassandra` version in which it
shipped.

#### 6.0.0 (Aug 3, 2021)

This packages `cqlsh` `6.0.0` from [Cassandra 4.0](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.0.0/bin/cqlsh.py):
* Requires Python 3.6+ or 2.7 (although support for Python 2 is deprecated).
* Although this is pulled from a Cassandra `4.x` release, it should generally work against Cassandra `3.x` clusters without needing to set any flags.


#### 6.0.0b4 (Mar 9, 2021)

This packages `cqlsh` `5.0.1` from [Cassandra 4.0-beta4](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.0-beta4/bin/cqlsh.py):
* Now supports Python 3.
* Although this is pulled from a Cassandra `4.x` release, it should generally work against Cassandra `3.x` clusters without needing to set any flags.
