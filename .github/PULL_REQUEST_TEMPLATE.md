Because this is a repackaging of `cqlsh` from the official [Cassandra repo](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/cassandra.git), **only issues / PRs related to PyPI packaging should be opened against this repo**.

If you would like to contribute to `cqlsh` itself, [find out more information here](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Otherwise, if your PR is still appropriate for this repo, then replace this warning with your PR description. And thanks for improving `cqlsh`!
